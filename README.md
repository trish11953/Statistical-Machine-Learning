# Machine-Learning

Welcome to my Machine Learning Repository! This repository is a collection of various machine learning projects and experiments I have worked on during my academic and professional journey. These projects showcase my understanding of a wide range of machine learning concepts, techniques, and algorithms, such as classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble learning.

## Introduction
Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task without being explicitly programmed. This repository contains projects that demonstrate my skills in various machine learning techniques, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning, using a variety of real-world datasets.

## Projects
Here's a list of some topics included in this repository:

KNN on Vertebral Column Data Set: Implementing the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for classification of vertebral column conditions using the Vertebral Column Data Set.

KNN Regression on Combined Cycle Power Plant Dataset: Applying the KNN algorithm for regression on the Combined Cycle Power Plant dataset to predict the net hourly electrical energy output.

Feature Creation/Extraction and Binary and Multiclass Classification on Time Series Data: Developing feature extraction techniques for time series data and performing binary and multiclass classification using various machine learning models.

Decision Trees using LASSO, PCR, and XGBoost: Building decision tree models with regularization techniques like LASSO and Principal Component Regression (PCR) and comparing their performance with XGBoost, a gradient boosting framework.
